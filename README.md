# Homer Shie Portfolio Website

This repository contains the static files for **Homer Shie**'s personal portfolio website.

The site was originally built using a modern front-end workflow (e.g. Vue with Vite). The compiled assets under `assets/` and other folders were generated from source code maintained in a separate private repository.

## Previewing locally

If you want to preview the site locally, serve the files with any static file server. For example:

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

Then open `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.

## Deploying

These files can be hosted on any static hosting service. For GitHub Pages, push the contents of this repository to your `main` branch, ensure the `CNAME` file matches your custom domain (if any), and enable GitHub Pages in the repository settings.
